<a href='' >House [[ insert deployed link here ]]</a> introduces you to others that have been accepted to your school. This helps you get from "decent" roommates to ones who won't decide to host a giant party the night before you've got a big project in the morning. You'll be surrounded with peers that are pursuing the same goals, which means less distraction and more motivation.

Our platform is about coordination. Consolidate all communication on site and simplify the house-hunting experience.

Upvote/downvote listings that you like to narrow down the search. View the general neighborhood of the listing along with the distance from your daily commute [school or work], right next to your monthly rent.
